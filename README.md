# Release Notes

Open Project is an online interactive real-time web-based project monitoring, tracking and visualization platform. The platform was developed for a national program and launched in January 2015 to monitor, track and manage over 60,000 projects. This web-based MIS provides a set of unique features including a management interface, interactive visualizations and dashboards and public interface for displaying and communicating project information in real-time to the public. The development of the platform was conducted by multiple development firms based in the United States and in the Philippines. Open Project ("white-label version") is being released via GitHub under an Open Source initiative to assist other countries, practitioners and developers towards the development of light-weight web-based MIS platforms.

While the platform was sufficiently advanced in terms of programming and design in 2014 it should be noted that the pace of technology is rapid and there are numerous updates and fixes available for this platform. To this end there are many opportunities to further develop the platform with functional and aesthetic enhancements. To assist others a complete independent site audit was conducted in December 2015 before public release. For this, the code is released with the view that it is a good (not perfect) starting point for others to learn from and improve in their Open Data initiatives as well as to contribute back to this repository so that the greater community can continue to benefit.

# Site Audit

Prior to public release of the source code a site audit was performed in December 2015 by a third-party to assess the structure, issues and recommendations for future development. It is available within the repository and via a direct link: https://github.com/opengovt/open-project-monitoring-and-tracking/blob/master/2015-12-14-Open-Project-Site-Audit.pdf

We strongly encourage that these recommendations be followed for all who would use this platform.
